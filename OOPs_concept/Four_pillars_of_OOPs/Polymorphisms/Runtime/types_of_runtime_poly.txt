parent* a= new parent   -> then parent wala method print hoga

parent* a=new child     -> then again pointer(parent) wala method print hoga
                           this is called upcasting

child* a= new child    -> then pointer(child) wala method print hoga

child* a=(child*) new parent -> pointer wala hi method print hoga
                           this is called downcasting

if we have use virtual keyword before the function(example-> virtual void fun())
  -> then new keyword ke bagal wale class(object type) ka method print hoga
